# Count-incrementing-program-version-1-
The app increments the count from by 1 whenever the increment button is clicked. The new incremented value is printed on the console everytime button is clicked

I am in the processing of making a program that increments the count by 1 whenever clicked (on the increment button provided) and displays the new incremented count on the screen
